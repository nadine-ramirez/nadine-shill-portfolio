Hi everyone, I’m Nadine Shill, a Master’s student in Applied and Computational Mathematics at Johns Hopkins University. I'm passionate about math, data analysis, and machine learning. 

Currently, I’m an AI Engineering intern at Solari, an ethical AI and legal organization, where I have built, helped refine, and collaborated on a few projects. I’m working to polish them for deployment. 

I started this blog to document my progress, share ideas, and build in public. Whether it’s the project is small or major, every experience helps me learn and brings me closer to a career doing what I love. 

Join me on this journey as I explore, create, and grow. I'm excited to share this with you all.
